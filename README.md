1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The first thing is to ask questions and get an understanding of what is wanted. Not just what they say they want but also implied wants based on what they talk about and how they talk about it. If I am working alone, I will sit down and try to figure out how to implement these needs. If I have a team, we will discuss it as a team and come up with a plan. User stories are a way to express the needs of the users for the entire team to understand.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

What I have done so far is to come up with what I need to get done. Then figure out what needs to be done first through last. Followed by starting the work and adjusting the plan as I develop the code. I think that these practices should be implemented on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes practice is needed and others it is not. I would like to use them all a few times and see which ones work best for me.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in my personal opinion is one that speaks up if they have a question, thought, idea, and or concern. They avoid being rude or try to speak in a confusing manner. They take thoughts, suggestions, criticism, and so on and try to always improve themselves, the code they write and so on.
